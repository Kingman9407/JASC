            <h1>Android studio</h1>
            Android Studio, built on IntelliJ IDEA, supports Kotlin, Java, and C++ with tools like a code editor, emulator, and Git integration to streamline app creation.

            Recently, Android Studio has become increasingly resource-intensive, demanding higher performance and significant disk space. Unfortunately, the official requirements often lack sufficient detail for optimal setup guidance
            <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
            <ul class="custom-bullets">
                <li>CPU : Intel i3 8100 / AMD Ryzen 3 2200G</li>
                <li>RAM : 8 GB</li>
                <li>OS  : 64-bit Microsoft Windows 8</li>
                <li>Disk space : 8 GB HDD</li>
                <li>Screen resolution :1280 x 800</li>
              </ul>
              The following performance metrics are based on testing conducted with an Intel i5-8265U processor. While CPUs with lower performance may still function adequately, this processor serves as the minimum benchmark tested for error-free operation of Android Studio.
              <i>Note: The CPU recommendation is unofficial, other metrics follow Googleâ€™s guidelines.</i>
              <h2>Recommended Requirements</h2>
              <ul class="custom-bullets">
                <li>CPU : Intel i3 12100 / AMD Ryzen 5 5600g</li>
                <li>RAM : 16 GB</li>
                <li>OS  : Latest 64-bit version of Windows</li>
                <li>Disk space : 30 GB SDD</li>
                <li>Screen resolution :1920 x 1080</li>
            </ul>
                For better performance, future-proofing, and faster code execution, more powerful CPUs are recommended. These specs provide excellent value, particularly for new PC builders seeking a reliable and efficient setup.
            <h2>For Better Performance</h2>
            <h3>Avoid Emulator</h3>
            Whenever possible, use a real device for testing instead of the emulator, as it generally provides better performance. Many people tend to use the emulator for app display, but a physical device offers more reliable results.
            <h3>Use SSD</h3>
            An SSD is essential for significantly improving execution time, and it's recommended to have at least 30GB of free space to install all necessary library files.
            <h3>More Ram</h3>
            The more RAM your system has, the better the performance. Android Studio is quite memory-intensive, so it's recommended to have more than 16GB of RAM. Additionally, freeing up RAM space by closing unnecessary applications can further improve performance.
