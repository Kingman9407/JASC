          <h1>LPDDR5/LPDDR5X is Better than you think:</h1>
         LPDDR5 /LPDDR5X replacing DDR5 in laptops is a rising trend driven by the need for better power efficiency and compact designs. LPDDR5 is becoming the preferred choice for premium Slim laptops.

            <h2>Things to Know Before You Buy a Laptop with LPDDR5</h2>
            <li>- DDR5 is faster than LPDDR5/LPDDR5X, but the difference is unnoticeable in low to mid-range laptops.</li>
            <li>- LPDDR5/LPDDR5X is soldered to the laptop motherboard and cannot be upgraded.</li>
            <li>- LPDDR5/LPDDR5X is more expensive than DDR5.</li>
            <li>- LPDDR5X consumes less power and very low power at idle.</li>
            <li>- It is worth noting that high-performance laptops like Asus A14 (Ryzen 7 8845HS, RTX 4050) have 16GB LPDDR5X in dual channel.</li>
            <li>- DDR5 is easier to repair and replace.</li>

          <h2>Slim Laptops:</h2>
          Most of slim laptops like  like Asus Zenbook S 14( Intel Core Ultra 7 258V),HP ENVY (Intel Core Ultra 5 ) uses LPPDR ram to reduce space and reduce the ideal battery consumption
          <h2>LPDDR5 iGPU Perormance:</h2>
          the integrated GPU tend to perform bit faster in LPDDR5 but performance is not directly from the LPDDR-ram but from but the way it implemented in motherboard by the manufacturer(can differ from  manufacturer to manufacturer)
          <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
          LPDDR5 performs similarly to DDR5 in day-to-day tasks while being more energy-efficient. However, remember that LPDDR cannot be upgraded, so it’s recommended to purchase at least 16GB.
