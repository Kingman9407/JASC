<p>Since the launch of Apple’s M1 processor on November 10, 2020, ARM's capabilities have been on full display, showcasing how it can compete robustly with x86 counterparts. ARM's efficiency has made it the go-to choice for many laptop users, shifting the focus from purely performance-oriented goals to a balance of performance and efficiency.shifting the focus from the x86 laptops</p>

<h2>x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group</h2>

<p>On October 15, 2024, Intel and AMD announced the formation of the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group to collaboratively to combat the rising influence of ARM . CEOs from major tech companies, including Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Red Hat, participated in the announcement event. Despite this partnership, Intel and AMD will continue to compete fiercely within the CPU market.</p>

<h2>Is Efficiency the New Goal for Modern Computers?</h2>

<p>Following the success of Apple’s M1, which excelled in efficiency, Intel has also shifted its focus. The latest Intel Core Ultra 285K matches or, in some cases, slightly lags behind its predecessor's performance but is up to 30% more efficient.</p>

<h2>NVIDIA and MediaTek Partnership</h2>

<p>There are rumors that NVIDIA and MediaTek are collaborating to launch an ARM-based chip for Windows laptops in 2025, aimed at competing with Snapdragon’s X Elite processors. this may be one of the reason for x86 advisory group </p>
