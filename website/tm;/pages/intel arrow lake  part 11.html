        <h1>INTEL ARROW LAKE</h1>
        The Arrow Lake CPUs, including the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, Intel Core Ultra 7 265K, and Intel Core Ultra 5 245K, have been launched alongside the Z890 motherboards. The Intel Core Ultra 200 series shows strong performance in productivity, though it performs about 5% slower than its predecessor, the Intel 14th Gen, in gaming. It also features Major hardware-level differences.
       <h2>Major Changes in Intel Core 200s</h2>
       <h3>No hyper-threading</h3>
       the latest in desktop cpu Intel Core Utra 200s series dosnt feature the hyper-threading technology like the 14th gen CPUs.
       Intel's introduction of hybrid cores—P-cores (Performance) and E-cores (Efficient)—reduces the efficiency gains from hyper-threading, minimizing the benefit of this complex technology.
       Hyper-threading requires each thread to have its own registers, which can drive up the cost of multi-core processors.
       <h3>Intel's New chiplet design</h3>
       this is the first time Intel using chiplet design like AMD using it for past years.The chiplet design give higher yeild compared to monolithich chip design and significantly reduce 
       the price of an processor of the processor . this comes in a huge cost performance drop in terms of latency when multiple cores are used the information has to transimitted from on chiplet to another
       <h3>Greater Efficiency then 14th gen</h3>   
       The 14th Gen is much more power-hungry compared to the new Core 200 series. While the Core 200 series is nearly 32% more efficient, it still lags behind AMD in power efficiency. However, this efficiency improvement addresses many of the stability issues seen with the 14th Gen CPUs.
